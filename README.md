## 🛡️ API Exception Handling  

This project uses a structured approach to handle API errors gracefully:  

1. **Exception Layer**:  
   - Custom exceptions are defined for common API issues like server errors, unauthorized access, or network unavailability.  

2. **Error Handling**:  
   - API errors are caught in the service layer and converted into user-friendly messages.  
   - Users are informed of API errors through non-intrusive **snack bars**, **dialogs**, or **error screens**.  
   
3. **Logging**:  
   - Errors are logged for debugging and monitoring purposes during development.  

This ensures users experience minimal disruption even during network or server issues.
